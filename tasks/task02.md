# Task 02
- Points: 10
- Description: The OMDB API requries an API Key therefore the MCP Server must access and use it
1. Go to `https://www.omdbapi.com/` and create an API Key
2. API Keys should not be hardcoded. Find a secure way to provide the API key to the MCP server. Avoid storing the API key in your system or user environment variables, as this is not secure. API keys should be treated like passwords and stored securely, using a secrets manager or a similar secure method, but each user should be able to use their own.
